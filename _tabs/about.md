# I build things that drive themselves.

For the past decade, I've been obsessed with making machines move without human hands on the wheel. I've built simulation platforms that test autonomous vehicles before they hit real roads, written patents on how to break AI drivers in creative ways, and — when the simulations got boring — started breaking records with real cars.

**Currently:** VP of SRE at [NScale](https://nscale.com), building infrastructure for the AI era.

**Previously:** Led autonomy simulation at a major automaker. Built the systems that let engineers crash thousands of virtual cars so real ones don't.

## The Record That Took 9 Years

In 2016, Elon Musk promised a Tesla would drive itself coast-to-coast. In January 2026, we finally made it happen.

_Somewhere between "this is amazing" and "holy shit it's snowing"_

**3,081 miles. 58 hours. Zero interventions.**

With Alex Roy and Paul Pham, I completed the first zero-intervention Tesla FSD trip from LA to NYC. Not a single touch of the wheel — not even during charging stops. When we accidentally left a team member at a Pennsylvania rest stop, we drove 90 minutes out of the way to pick him up rather than disengage.

We drove straight into a Midwest winter storm. FSD handled it.

> "CRAZIEST events in snow – but FSD did it! Snow performance and recovery is unreal."

This wasn't my first rodeo — I was part of the team that set the [Electric and Autonomous Cannonball records back in 2017](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/5301/how-we-broke-the-electric-and-autonomous-cannonball-run-records). Also got to ride shotgun in a [robot race car for WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/my-wild-ride-in-robot-race-car/).

## Say Hi

I'm always up for talking about autonomy, simulation, infrastructure, or why your FSD version is better/worse than mine.

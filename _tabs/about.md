# About Me

I'm a technology executive with deep expertise in autonomous vehicles, AI simulation, and infrastructure at scale. Currently serving as **VP of SRE at NScale**, a neocloud provider.

Previously, I held autonomy executive roles at major automakers, where I led development of simulation platforms for autonomous vehicle testing. I hold multiple patents in AV simulation and testing methodologies.

### 🏆 First Zero-Intervention Tesla FSD Coast-to-Coast (January 2026)

Alongside **Alex Roy** and **Paul Pham**, I completed the first-ever zero-intervention Tesla Full Self-Driving trip from Los Angeles to New York City.

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Distance | 3,081 miles |
| Time | 58 hours, 22 minutes |
| Interventions | **Zero** |
| Hardware | Tesla Model S, HW4, FSD v14.2.2.3 |

Not even during charging stops did anyone touch the controls. When a team member was stranded at a Pennsylvania rest stop, we drove a 90-minute detour to pick him up rather than disengage FSD.

> "CRAZIEST events in snow – but FSD did it! Holy s**t. Snow performance and recovery is unreal."  
> — Alex Roy

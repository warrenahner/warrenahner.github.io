## Patents

### High-Value Test Generation For Autonomous Vehicles
**US 20190271614**

The problem with testing self-driving cars: there are infinite scenarios, but finite time. This patent covers methods for finding the *right* scenarios — the edge cases and weird situations that actually break things.

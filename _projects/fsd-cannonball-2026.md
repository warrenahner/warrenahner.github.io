In 2016, Elon Musk promised a Tesla would drive itself coast-to-coast by the end of 2017. Nine years later, we actually did it.

## The Numbers

| | |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 3,081 miles |
| **Time** | 58 hours, 22 minutes |
| **Interventions** | Zero |
| **Hardware** | Tesla Model S, HW4, FSD v14.2.2.3 |
| **Charging time** | 10 hours, 11 minutes |

## The Rules

Simple: nobody touches the wheel. Not to correct a lane change. Not to speed up. Not even during charging stops.

## The Weather

We drove into a winter storm. Not around it. *Through* it.

The route took us on I-10 through Arizona, then I-40 toward Oklahoma City and St. Louis. By the time we hit the Midwest, weather radar was showing red everywhere. Snow squalls. Icy roads. Visibility that dropped to nothing.

FSD kept driving.

## The Rest Stop Incident

Somewhere in western Pennsylvania, we stopped for a bathroom break. One team member got out... and the car drove away.

Rather than disengage FSD to turn around, we completed a **90-minute detour** to circle back and pick him up.

That's commitment.

## The Team

- **Alex Roy** — Cannonball legend, general partner at NIVC, the guy who's been trying to prove Musk right for almost a decade
- **Paul Pham** — FSD obsessive who knows every quirk of every version  
- **Warren Ahner** — Former autonomy exec (that's me), here to see if simulation work translates to real roads

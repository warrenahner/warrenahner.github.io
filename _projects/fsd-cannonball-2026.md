## The Achievement

In January 2026, alongside Alex Roy and Paul Pham, I completed what Elon Musk promised in 2016: a Tesla driving itself from coast to coast without human intervention.

**The Stats:**
- **Distance:** 3,081 miles (Los Angeles to New York City)
- **Time:** 58 hours, 22 minutes
- **Average Speed:** 64 mph
- **Interventions:** Zero (not even during charging)
- **Hardware:** Tesla Model S with HW4, FSD v14.2.2.3
- **Charging Time:** 10 hours, 11 minutes

## The Journey

The route followed I-10 from Southern California through Arizona, then I-40 toward Oklahoma City and St. Louis before cutting northeast to NYC. We drove directly into a Midwest winter storm system.

The team was so committed to zero interventions that when one member was left at a Pennsylvania rest stop, we completed a 90-minute detour to circle back rather than disengage FSD.

## White Papers

**ADAS Development & Testing**  
How to test driver-assistance systems without killing anyone. Covers simulation frameworks, scenario generation, and validation methodologies.

📄 [PDF](/WhitePapers/adas.pdf) ・ 🌐 [HTML](/WhitePapers/adas.html)

**WorldSim**  
The simulation platform I helped build — making virtual worlds realistic enough that when an AV passes testing, you actually trust it.

## Patents

**High-Value Test Generation For Autonomous Vehicles** — US 20190271614

The problem with testing self-driving cars: there are infinite scenarios, but finite time. This patent covers methods for finding the *right* scenarios — the edge cases and weird situations that actually break things.

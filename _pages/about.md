I'm a technology executive with deep expertise in autonomous vehicles, AI simulation, and infrastructure at scale. Currently serving as **VP of SRE at NScale**, a neocloud provider.

Previously, I held autonomy executive roles at major automakers, where I led development of simulation platforms for autonomous vehicle testing. I hold multiple patents in AV simulation and testing methodologies.

## World Records

Alongside Alex Roy and Paul Pham, I completed the first-ever zero-intervention Tesla Full Self-Driving trip from Los Angeles to New York City—3,081 miles in 58 hours with absolutely no human intervention, not even during charging stops.

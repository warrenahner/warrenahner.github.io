In 2016, Elon Musk promised a Tesla would drive itself coast-to-coast by the end of 2017.

Nine years later, we actually did it.

## The Bet

Alex Roy has been testing every version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving against Musk's original promise. Each time, something would go wrong — a phantom brake, a missed exit, a snowstorm that confused the cameras. Each time, the record remained unset.

FSD v14.2.2.3 changed that.

## The Run

**Start:** Portofino Inn, Redondo Beach — the official Cannonball finish line (we ran it in reverse)  
**End:** New York City  
**Distance:** 3,081 miles  
**Time:** 58 hours, 22 minutes  
**Interventions:** Zero  

The rules were simple: nobody touches the wheel. Not to correct a lane change. Not to speed up for a pass. Not even during charging stops.

## The Team

- **Alex Roy** — Cannonball legend, general partner at NIVC, the guy who's been trying to prove Musk right for almost a decade
- **Paul Pham** — FSD obsessive who knows every quirk of every version
- **Me** — Former autonomy exec, here to see if my simulation work actually translates to real roads

## The Weather

We drove into a winter storm.

Not around it. Not after it passed. *Through* it.

The route took us on I-10 through Arizona, then I-40 toward Oklahoma City and St. Louis. By the time we hit the Midwest, we were watching weather radar on the Tesla's screen and seeing red everywhere.

Snow squalls. Icy roads. Visibility that dropped to nothing.

FSD kept driving.

> "CRAZIEST events in snow – but FSD did it! Holy s**t. Snow performance and recovery is unreal."

## The Rest Stop Incident

Somewhere in western Pennsylvania, we stopped for a bathroom break. The car was still in FSD mode. One of us got out, walked inside... and the car drove away.

Not a malfunction — we just forgot to wait.

Rather than disengage FSD to turn around, we completed a **90-minute detour** to circle back and pick him up. That's how committed we were to zero interventions.

(He was fine. Cold, but fine.)

## Why It Matters

This wasn't a demo. There were no Tesla engineers riding along. No special hardware. No cherry-picked route in perfect weather.

This was three guys, a production Tesla, and a snowstorm.

Nine years after the promise, FSD finally delivered.

Nine years after Elon Musk promised a Tesla would drive itself coast-to-coast, we finally made it happen.

## The Achievement

Alongside **Alex Roy** and **Paul Pham**, I just completed the first-ever zero-intervention Tesla Full Self-Driving trip from Los Angeles to New York City.

**The numbers:**
- **3,081 miles** in **58 hours, 22 minutes**
- **Zero interventions** — not even during charging stops
- Running HW4 and FSD version 14.2.2.3
- 10 hours, 11 minutes of charging time

## The Journey

The route followed I-10 from Redondo Beach through Arizona, then I-40 toward Oklahoma City and St. Louis before cutting northeast into a Midwest winter storm.

> "CRAZIEST events in snow – but FSD did it! Holy s**t. Snow performance and recovery is unreal."

The team was so committed to zero interventions that when one member was stranded at a Pennsylvania rest stop, we completed a **90-minute detour** to circle back and pick him up rather than disengage FSD.

## Why It Matters

This was the first true demonstration of what Tesla's Full Self-Driving system can do on the exact route Musk promised nearly a decade ago. Not a sunny cruise to South Carolina — the real deal, through winter storms, to New York City.

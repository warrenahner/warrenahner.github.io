In October 2017, Alex Roy, Franz Aliquo, and I broke both the electric vehicle *and* autonomous Cannonball Run records in a single trip — covering 2,877 miles from Redondo Beach, California to the Red Ball Garage in New York in 55 hours, with 97.7% of that time using Tesla's Autopilot.

## The Team

- **Alex Roy** — Cannonball legend, held the 2006 gas-powered record of 31:04
- **Franz Aliquo** — Founder of Streetwars and Rental Car Rally, master strategist
- **Me (Warren "Mr. X" Ahner)** — Cybersecurity expert and racing instructor, with "amazing insights" into extracting maximum performance from both the Tesla's battery and Autopilot

Alex barely knew us before the drive. Franz and I only met the night before departure. But opposing personalities and skill sets work well in high-pressure scenarios.

## The Car

A 2016 Tesla Model S 90D — specifically *not* the P90D Ludicrous variant. Why? The P90D accelerates faster but has about 25 miles less range. Weight is the enemy of efficiency. We also ran on smaller 19-inch wheels to save weight and add range.

## The Route

There is only one optimal route: the shortest distance along Tesla's Supercharger network, approximately 2,877 miles. The most ideal gas-car route is 2,811 miles, but we're bound by charging infrastructure.

## How We Beat the Prior Record

The previous EV Cannonball record was 57:48. We projected 55:45 and shocked ourselves with 55:00 flat.

The semi-secret sauce:
- Study ambient temperatures and estimate battery temps
- Be strategic about speed (wind resistance kills range over 70 mph)
- Optimize charging stops based on real-time conditions

We hit multiple storms, including what seemed like a tornado, costing us at least 90 minutes. Despite that, our range optimization exceeded our best estimates.

As Alex put it: "It really helped having Mr. X in the car."

## The Autopilot Question

97.7% of the drive was on Autopilot. We kept at least one hand on the wheel at all times — involuntary disengagements are for amateurs. Autopilot isn't a self-driving car, even though it often feels like one.

The kind of person who has an accident with it is the kind of person who has an accident without it.

## The Tech Stack

*The full tech stack: radar detectors, GPS tracking, Waze, and more*

- iPad Mini running Waze (traffic, accidents, police)
- Tesla's browser running web-based Waze variant as backup
- Valentine One radar/laser detector
- Escort Max360 connected via Bluetooth to iPhone
- Samsung Edge S7 running Comma.ai's Chffr for data logging
- US Fleet Tracking GPS unit for evidence
- Uniden Home Patrol II radio scanner
- Way too many GoPros

## Charging Strategy

![Supercharging](/assets/img/cannonball-2017-inline6.jpg)
*Quick Supercharger stops were essential*

We used Tesla's Supercharger network exclusively. Every minute counts, and so does every quarter mile to the on-ramp. Our charging stops were fewer than Tesla's GPS predicted — that's the optimization advantage.

## Is 55 Hours Breakable?

Absolutely. We could get back in the same car and cut two hours off. A better car? Three. With every improvement in battery and charging tech, times will fall.

*55 hours later: Red Ball Garage, New York City*

This will go on until electric cars match gas cars for range and charge times. Then someone will hack an autonomous EV and break the 28:50 Cannonball record.

Nine years later, we finally did something close to that — a zero-intervention coast-to-coast run in a Tesla with FSD v14.2.2.3.

Before there was a zero-intervention coast-to-coast run, there was this: the first attempt to break both the electric vehicle *and* autonomous Cannonball records in a single trip.

## The Challenge

The traditional Cannonball Run is about raw speed — getting from New York to LA as fast as possible. But we wanted to prove something different: that electric cars and semi-autonomous driving systems were ready for prime time.

## What We Learned

Tesla's Autopilot in 2017 was... not what it is today. It worked brilliantly on highways in good conditions. It got confused by construction. It really didn't like rain.

But it worked well enough to prove the concept. And it taught us what to look for in future versions.

## The Records

We set records for:
- **Electric vehicle Cannonball** — proving EVs could do long-distance with careful charging planning
- **Autonomous miles** — more hands-off miles than any previous attempt

This was the groundwork for what we finally achieved in 2026 with the zero-intervention run.

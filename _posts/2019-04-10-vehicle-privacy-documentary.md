I co-produced an investigation into vehicle data privacy. The findings were... not great.

## The Problem

Modern cars are surveillance devices on wheels. They track where you go, how you drive, who you call, what you listen to. Most people have no idea how much data their car collects — or who it gets shared with.

## The Documentary

## What We Found

- Cars collect far more data than most people realize
- Privacy policies are buried and incomprehensible
- Data gets shared with third parties in ways owners never agreed to
- Law enforcement can access vehicle data, often without warrants

## Why It Matters

As cars get smarter — and more autonomous — they collect even more data. Your self-driving car will know your daily patterns better than your spouse does. The privacy implications are massive, and the regulations haven't caught up.
